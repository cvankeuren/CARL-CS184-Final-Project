## What We Have Accomplished
Search Phase
- We have a fully implemented Nearest Neighbors algorithm for the search phase of our texture syntehsis. This allows us to find the exemplar patch that best aligns with our solid voxel slice. This process is sped up by applying a PCA projection to the neighborhood vectors in the exemplar and by searching a sparser grid than every voxel. An image of this proccess on a 2D voxel slice is shown below.
